# Reese's Python Learning Log

**Started:** 2025-12-09  
**Primary Focus:** DS Course (Krish Naik - Complete Data Science, ML, DL, NLP Bootcamp)  
**3-Month Goal:** Solve 5-6/10 Python problems from scratch in 30-60 min, explaining reasoning throughout

## WHO I AM

**Role:** Junior Python Developer at Cognizant  
**Day Job:** Data Science, ML, and Data Analytics pipelines  
**Learning Window:** 2-3 hours during 9-5 workday  
**Target:** Senior Python Engineer at Cognizant (specialization flexible)

**My Honest Baseline (as of 2025-12-09):**
- I know Python basics: loops, functions, classes, types, lists, dicts
- I can read and modify existing code
- I cannot build from scratch independently - I freeze at "thought to paper"
- Everything I've built has been with AI or external help
- The gap: neurons don't connect because AI fills in before I have to think

**What I've Been Exposed To (with help):**
- Multi-agent software team (dev, tester, security lead, team lead)
- MCP servers for file/directory read-write
- Customer data pipelines for insights on repeat callers and workflows

## SKILLS TRACKER

*Update when something genuinely levels up. Be honest.*

| Skill | Level | Notes | Last Practiced |
|-------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Python basics (loops, functions, classes) | Can use with reference | Cannot write from scratch confidently | 2025-12-09 |
| pandas | Exposed | Used in work, need AI help | - |
| numpy | Exposed | Used in work, need AI help | - |
| Data structures (lists, dicts) | Can use | Don't know when to pick which | - |
| DSA (algorithms) | Concept only | Can't implement | - |
| Stats/Probability | Gap | Need to learn | - |
| NLP techniques | Gap | Target skill from DS Course | - |

**Level definitions:**
- **Gap:** Haven't learned yet
- **Exposed:** Seen it, used it with help, can't do it alone
- **Can use with reference:** Can do it if I look things up
- **Can do independently:** No AI, no docs, I got this

## INDEPENDENCE TRACKER

*The whole point: proving you can do things WITHOUT AI*

| Date | Problem/Task | Difficulty | Solo Attempt Time | Result | Notes |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Result options:** Solved solo, Solved with hints, Needed AI, Gave up
