# Reese's Python Learning Log

**Started:** 2025-12-09
**Primary Focus:**

- Boot.dev backend path + RAG course
- Krish Naik DS/NLP Course (Udemy)
- neetcode problem-solving practice

**All resources now on personal device** — no work laptop dependencies.

**What Gets Logged:** Only direct Python coding practice and problem-solving attempts
**What Doesn't:** Work assignments, theory without practice, language diversions

**3-Month Goal:** Solve 5-6/10 Python problems from scratch in 30-60 min, explaining reasoning throughout

**Archive Files:**
- `weekly_log_archive.md` — Past weekly logs
- `monthly_log_archive.md` — Past monthly check-ins
```

## SKILLS TRACKER

*Update when something genuinely levels up. Be honest.*

| Skill | Level | Notes | Last Practiced |
|-------|-------|-------|----------------|
| [Skill name] | [Level] | [Notes including LEVELED UP flags] | [Date] |

**Level definitions:**

- **Gap:** Haven't learned yet
- **Exposed:** Seen it, used it with help, can't do it alone
- **Can use with reference:** Can do it if I look things up
- **Can implement with reasoning:** Understand the logic, may need syntax help
- **Can do independently:** No AI, no docs, I got this

## INDEPENDENCE TRACKER

*The whole point: proving you can do things WITHOUT AI*

| Date | Problem/Task | Difficulty | Solo Attempt Time | Result | Notes |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| [Date] | [Description] | [X/10] | [Time] | [Result] | [Details] |

**Result options:** Solved solo, Solved with hints, Needed AI, Gave up
