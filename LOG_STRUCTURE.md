# Python Learning Log - Structure Template

This file defines the structure for maintaining your Python learning logs. Copy sections as needed into your actual `PYTHON_LOG.md` file.

## 1. CURRENT FOCUS (Updated Weekly)

```markdown
### Week of [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Platform:** [Boot.dev / Coursera NLP & DS / neetcode]

**Topic:** [Specific module, chapter, or concept area]

**Time Invested:** [Approximate hours]

**What I Built/Practiced:**
- [Specific exercises, projects, or implementations]
- [Use concrete examples: "Built a rate limiter" not "practiced system design"]

**What Clicked:**
- [Breakthroughs or "aha" moments with enough detail to remember why]

**What's Still Fuzzy:**
- [Specific struggles with examples - "Can't figure out when to use heaps vs priority queues in dijkstra's" not just "dijkstra's is hard"]

**Architectural Question This Raises:**
- [How would this scale? What patterns am I using? What would break first?]
- [This becomes your Friday neetcode review focus]
```

## 2. KNOWLEDGE INVENTORY (Updated as Things Solidify)

Use status levels:
- **Learning**: Currently working on this, not comfortable yet
- **Comfortable**: Can implement with reference, understand the concept
- **Solid**: Can implement from memory, can explain to others

```markdown
### [Concept/Topic Name]

**Status:** [Learning / Comfortable / Solid]

**Last Practiced:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Can Do:**
- [Specific implementations you can handle]
- [Be concrete: "Can implement DFS on binary trees" not "understand trees"]

**Still Working On:**
- [Specific gaps or edge cases that trip you up]

**Used In:**
- [Project, work task, or exercise where you applied this]
- [Link to code if available]

**Resources:**
- [Helpful docs, articles, or course sections]
```

---

## 3. ACTIVE STRUGGLES (Running List)

```markdown
### [Specific Problem/Concept] - Added: [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Context:**
[Where you encountered this - work project, course exercise, etc.]

**The Problem:**
[What specifically isn't clicking, with examples if possible]

**What I've Tried:**
- [Approaches that didn't work or didn't make sense]
- [Questions you've asked AI or searched for]

**Current Understanding:**
[Where you are now - what parts make sense, what parts don't]

**Resolved:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
[How you figured it out - move full entry to Knowledge Inventory when resolved]
```

## 4. INTEGRATION LOG (Friday Reflections)

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Concepts Reviewed This Week:**
- [List what you worked on Mon-Thurs]

**System Design Thinking:**
- [Architectural decisions you'd make with what you learned]
- [Patterns you recognized or could apply]
- [Tradeoffs you're considering]

**Connections Made:**
- [How different concepts tie together]
- [Where Boot.dev + Coursera + neetcode overlap]
- [Real-world applications you see]

**Questions for Next Week:**
- [Things to explore further]
- [Concepts that need deeper understanding]
```

## 5. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES

Use these sections to track progress through specific courses/platforms:

```markdown
### Boot.dev Progress

**Current Module:** [Module name]
**Completion:** [X/Y lessons]
**Key Takeaways:**
- [Major concepts from this module]

### Coursera NLP & DS Progress

**Current Week:** [Week number]
**Completion:** [Videos watched, assignments done]
**Key Takeaways:**
- [Major concepts from this week]

### neetcode Progress

**Focus Area:** [DSA / System Design]
**Problems Completed:** [List with difficulty]
**Patterns Learned:**
- [Specific patterns or approaches]
```

## HOW TO USE THIS STRUCTURE

1. **Daily/After Each Session**: Update "Current Focus" with what you did
2. **When Something Clicks**: Move from "Active Struggles" to "Knowledge Inventory"
3. **When You're Stuck**: Add to "Active Struggles" with specific details
4. **Friday**: Fill out "Integration Log" reviewing the week
5. **Weekly**: Start a new "Current Focus" entry for the new week

## FOR AI ASSISTANCE

When asking Claude (or any AI) for help:
- Reference specific entries: "Check my Active Struggles for recursion"
- Ask for gap analysis: "What should I learn next based on my Knowledge Inventory?"
- Request reviews: "Review my Integration Log and suggest architectural patterns to explore"
- Get unstuck: "Help me resolve the struggle I logged about [topic]"

The AI can read your full log and provide contextual help based on what you know, what you're learning, and what you're struggling with.
