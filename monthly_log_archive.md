### Month: January 2026

**DS Course Progress:**

- Modules completed: Advanced Functions (01/19/26)
- Current module: [UPDATE]

**Boot.dev Progress:**

- Find Suspicious Users completed solo, 2 minutes (01/03/26)
- RAG course in progress — learning modularity patterns (01/07/26)
- Fix Shortest Social Connection (BFS) completed solo, 1 minute (01/19/26)
- Sum Task Durations Recursively (7/10) completed solo, 10 minutes (01/20/26)

**Independence Growth:**

- Problems solved solo this month: 3 (Find Suspicious Users 6/10, BFS fix 5/10, Sum Task Durations 7/10)
- Problems solved with hints: 0
- Module exercises completed: 15 (Advanced Functions)
- Hardest thing I did without AI: Sum Task Durations (7/10) — 10 minutes, recursive nested structure traversal

**Running total of independent solves:**

1. 10/10 functional programming (15 min) — Dec
2. 6/10 Find Suspicious Users (2 min) — Jan
3. 5/10 BFS shortest path (1 min) — Jan
4. 15x Advanced Functions exercises (~45-60 min total) — Jan
5. 7/10 Sum Task Durations recursion (10 min) — Jan

**Am I closer to the 3-month goal?**
Strong start to January. 7/10 in 10 minutes — ahead of the 5-6/10 in 30-60 min target. Data structure selection is becoming instinctive. BFS/DFS distinction now automatic. Recursion on nested structures now understood at the "can explain why it works" level, not just "can write working code" level. The Advanced Functions module reinforces patterns you already had (generators, composition) while adding new tools (decorators, currying, partial).

**Am I bouncing between systems or staying focused?**

**Honest assessment - what needs to change?**
